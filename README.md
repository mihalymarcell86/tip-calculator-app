## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass, BEM
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

First I used radio buttons to create the tip selectors, so that I can style them with the appropriate CSS pseudo classes.
I learned that, in terms of accessibility, this solution raised some problems. `tabindex` walks through the radio buttons, however if they are hidden, it doesn't highlight the labels. Even after defining `tabindex` on them, they cannot be selected with the keyboard, unless adding an event listener.
I decided to replace the radio buttons with divs and use conditional classes for the styling instead and assigning `role` attributes to

I ran into some problems with absolutely positioning the icons within the input field. Originally the fields were wrapped in a `fieldset`, and the titles were given as `legend`,
but it turned out that different browsers would calculate the coordinates within these elements differently, so I had to change them into `div`s.
